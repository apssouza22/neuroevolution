# Self-driving-car with Genetic algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks

This is a self-driving car game developed using the combination of 
Genetic algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks(NeuroEvolution). 

This project is a follow up on my project about [Artificial Neural Networks from scratch](https://github.com/apssouza22/neuralnet-browser) where I show how to create an ANN
from scratch without libraries. In that project the learning process is done using backpropagation(gradient descent), this project 
use a different approach, we will use Evolutionary Algorithm.

Evolutionary algorithm uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. 
Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions. 
Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

The project is developed from scratch and with no external libraries.

This project is heavily inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkI9ia2cLhc&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY) course.
