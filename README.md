# Self-driving-car

This is a self-driving car game developed using the combination of 
Genetic algorithm and Neural Network(NeuroEvolution). 

The project is developed from scratch and with no external libraries.

The learning process utilizes two different approaches:
- NeuroEvolution (Genetic algorithm and Neural Network)
- Reinforcement learning(WIP)

This project is heavily inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkI9ia2cLhc&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY) course.
