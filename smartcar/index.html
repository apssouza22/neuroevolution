            NeuralNetwork contains virtual "neurons" that are arranged in layers that are connected to each other. The neurons pass on the information and thereby perform calculations.

        <p>
            <strong>Weights == arrows</strong> <br>
            Learning occurs, in part, by the strengthening of connections between neurons. <br>
            With weighted inputs, the network can increase or decrease the strength of the connection between each neuron in this layer and the neurons in the next layer. <br>
            Weights are the co-efficients of the equation which you are trying to resolve during the training phase.<br>
            The weights are displayed in arrows between the neurons. The weights strengths are displayed as the arrow's alphas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Bias == cycle around neurons</strong> <br>
            While weights enable an artificial neural network to adjust the strength of connections between neurons,
            bias can be used to make adjustments within neurons. <br>
            Basically the addition of bias reduces the variance and hence introduces flexibility and better generalisation to the neural network(non-linearity). <br>
            The bias strengths are displayed as the cycle's alphas

        <p><strong>Network colors:</strong> <br>
            RED elements are negative values<br>
            YELLOW are positive values
