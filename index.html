        NeuralNetwork contains virtual "neurons" that are arranged in layers that are connected to each other. The neurons pass on the information and thereby perform calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Weights == arrows</strong> <br>
        The connections between the neurons also have values associated with them, called weights.
        Those weights tell us how much the information from one layer matters for the next layer.
        The weights are displayed in arrows between the neurons. The weights strengths are displayed
        as the arrows' alphas.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bias == cycle around neurons</strong> <br>
        The two parameters WEIGHT and BIAS differ in the extent of their INFLUENCE upon the input data.
        Simply, bias represents how far off the predictions are from their intended value.
        Biases make up the DIFFERENCE between the neuron's output and its intended output
